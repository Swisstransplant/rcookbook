## Swisstransplant R cookbook

This repo is home to the Swisstransplant R cookbook. It includes instructions on installing [`swt`](https://github.com/schw4b/swt), the R package that we have created to produce statistics and ggplot2 charts in our in-house style. 

The cookbook is available at this link:
