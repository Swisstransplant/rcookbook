# Swisstransplant cookbook for R

The Swisstransplant R cookbook is a practical guide for generating reproducible, high-quality statistical reports using our custom R package [`swt`](https://github.com/Swisstransplant/swt).

To publish the cookbook, use the Windows Command Prompt (and no bash emulation) and navigate to the project directory; then type:

```
quarto publish gh-pages R/rcookbook.qmd
```
